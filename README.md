# 🌊 Flooder - History Flooder Disguised as a School Calculator

**Flooder** is a powerful tool that disguises itself as a school calculator while secretly functioning as a history flooder. By entering a specific code, the true shape of Flooder is revealed, allowing you to flood your browser history with the current page. 💥

**Note: Please use this tool responsibly and for educational purposes only. Flooding your history may have unintended consequences and can affect browser performance. ⚠️**

## Features

## Getting Started

To use **Flooder**, follow these steps:

After making your choice, copy paste the code inside the file and right click on your bookmark bar.
Click add page, name it School Calculator so teachers won't know it, and then in the url, put the code.
